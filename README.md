# Field-Oriented Control of a PMSM
This is the github reposity of an academic project at the University of Paris-Saclay.

## Project Objectives (Non-exhaustive list)
- Gaining a thorough understanding of dq-modeling and implementing dq and inverse dq transformations on Simulink.
- Conducting a parameter indetification by which the necessary parameters for modeling our machine were obtained.
- Modeling and simulation of a permanent magnet synchronous motor on Simulink.
- Implementing Speed and current control (in addition to compensator parameter tuning).
- Modeling and simulation of the vector control scheme.
- Coparing our results to the project specifications.
